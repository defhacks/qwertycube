      <h2>QWERTYcube - Keyboard oriented Rubik's Cube</h2>
      by Steven Elliott based on rubik_scrambler by Siddhante Nangla
      <p/>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>As the name suggests QWERTYcube was originally intended to be a keyboard
      based cube.  However, it has evolved to have mouse support as well as
      touch support on mobile devices.  If you just want to see a reference
      describing the buttons and keys <a href="#key-tables">scroll down</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Keyboard</h3>
      <p>The keyboard can be used to either make moves in the expected
      way (R, L, U, D, etc.) or for various commands (T, L, etc.).  Some
      commands that destroy information, such as N and P, require that Alt and
      Shift be pressed at the same time. For moves Alt and Shift make the
      move double layer and inverse respectively.  Also for moves a numeric
      prefix may be typed immediately before a move.  For example, pressing 2
      then Shift-R results in move 2R' (move the second layer from R in the R'
      direction).  Prefixes can also be applied to double layer moves (2r, for
      example).  Prefixes may have ranges.  For example 2-5L would move layers
      2 through 5 from L in the L direction.  All three middle moves (E, M, S)
      and entire cube rotations (X, Y and Z) are supported.  The keys can be
      reconfigured (see "Settings").  Note that some of the command keys have
      numeric alternatives.  This is helpful when the Heise key mapping is
      active. Finally, some commands may still be accessible via shift.  For
      example, when Heise is enabled Shift-J will scramble the cube.</p>
      <h3>Mouse And Touch</h3>
      <p>Mouse and touch support should be intuitive, but there are some things
      about it that may not be obvious.  Clicking on the grey background
	  rotates the entire cube.  Note that when the cube is rotated this way
	  the R, L, U, D, etc. labels follow the cube (see "Orientation labels").
	  If rotation lock (see "Rotation lock") is on the program does it's best
      to interpret movement on the grey background near the cube as being a cube
      move.</p>
	  <p>Clicking the mouse on the cube and moving results in a cube move.
	  Although it should be obvious how this works in the case of moving a
	  single layer it's also possible to move multiple layers, such as a
	  double layer move (r, etc.) or even the entire cube (x, etc.).  To move
      multiple layers the swipe should cross a layer boundary.  All touched
      layers will rotate.</p>
      <p>Clicking the mouse on the cube and not moving (a single click) will
      also produce a cube movement.  In all cases the move direction is toward
      the side closest to the click.  For edge stickers a single move is
      possible.  For corners, two moves are possible.  For middle stickers any
      of the four directions are possible for an entire cube rotation.</p>
      <p>Multi-touch is supported for mobile devices in order to make multiple
      moves simultaneously as long as the moves are compatible.  See Move
      Consolidation.</p>
      <h3>Move Consolidation</h3>
      <p>Multiple moves may be consolidated into a single move as long as they
      are compatible.  Moves are considered to be compatible if they go the
      same direction and amount around the same axis.  For example, L and M can
      be consolidated to form l.  The consolidation is done if the moves are
      made close to the same time, either by pressing keys or multi-touch.
      This allows key mappings, such as Heise, to be used that depend on being
      able to make simultaneous compatible moves.</p>
      <h3>Savepoints</h3>
      <p>If the cube is in a state that you want to get back to later then click
      Savepoint or the C key.  You might do this if you've reached the OLL or
      PLL stage and you're not sure if you can do the algorithm correctly, so
      you want to be able to go back and try again if you make a mistake.
      Normally Undo or G key undoes a single move, but that behavior can be
      modified by the Alt (instead of a single move go until the next
      savepoint) or Shift (redo instead of undo).  See the
      <a href="#help-modifier-keys">modifier key table</a>.</p>
      <h3>Scrambling</h3>
      <p>By default when Scramble or J is pressed a random-state scrambler
      named "jsss" is used to scramble the cube.  It works by randomly
      selecting a cube from all possible cubes, and then inverting the solution.
      It should be as good as scrambling the cube with an infinite number of
      random moves.  Alternatively the "simple" scrambler can be used which is
      faster, but not as good.  Push Config or I and look for scrambleMoves
      to see the moves used to scramble the cube.  Look for scrambleType to
      see or change scrambler type.  A savepoint is created after each scramble,
      which means pressing UndoA or Alt-G will undo the scramble and Redo
      All or Alt-Shift-G will then redo the scramble.  By default the scramble
      moves are applied to the existing cube.  If instead you wish to start
      with a new cube, and then apply the scramble moves to that new cube, press
      Alt-Shift-J instead of J.  For non-keyboard users press New and then
      Scramble.</p>
      <h3>Timer</h3>
      <p>A timer an be toggled by pressing Timer or T.  Scrambling the cube
      starts a 15 second count down at which time the timer is red. This is the
      inspection period.  During the inspection period you may rotate the entire
      cube via clicking on the grey background, mouse gestures or axis keys.
      If you make an actual move during the inspection period the inspection
      period will end and the timer will turn green and start counting up.
      Once the cube is solved the timer will stop and will turn yellow to show
      the solve time.  The timer also turns green and starts counting up upon
      New or N just in case you want to time something that way.  The timer is
      off by default due to potentially high CPU usage.</p>
      <h3>Settings</h3>
      <p>Pressing the Config or I displays the settings dialog.  This is
      where various obscure and advanced settings are stored.  Things like the
      background color, cube color, cube size, animation, initial cube
      facelets, etc. can be configured in the settings dialog.  Read the text
      at the start of the settings dialog for an overview of how settings work.
      Click Ok to store the settings to persistent storage.  Note that the
      settings dialog can be used in this way to save settings that were not
      set in the settings dialog.  For example, let's say you've engaged
      rotation lock by pressing Lock or K and you've rotated the cube slightly
      change the perspective and you want it this way the next time QWERTYcube
      is loaded.  To save that and all other settings to persistent storage
      click Config or I and then click Ok.  Note that persistent storage can
      be cleared by pressing Reset or P.</p>
      <h3>Query Parameters</h3>
      <p>It's possible to override the built in defaults for the variables that
      can be seen in the settings dialog by appending HTTP query parameters
      to the URL.  For example, when the page is first loaded to set the
      cubiesOrder to 4 and to set cubiesColorOverrides to
      "R:grey L:magenta I:0x224466" append
      "?cubiesOrder=4&cubiesColorOverrides=R%3Agrey%20L%3Amagenta%20I%3A0x224466"
      to the URL.  Note the percent encoding.  The user can override the values
      via the settings dialog.

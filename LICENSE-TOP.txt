In it's current form QWERTYcube includes both MIT and GPLv3 licensed code
which means it's dual licensed under both licenses.  However, the GPL code
can be removed by removing the JSSS scrambler, which is GPLv3:
    git revert 0f4c5f4a6608b60b91aeba6fc6d47737aba8b9e8
For the licenses see the specific license file:
    LICENSE-GPLv3.txt
    LICENSE-MIT.txt

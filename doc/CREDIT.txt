There are people who helped with QWERTYcube that I'd like to thank.

* A big thanks to Siddhante Nangla who wrote rubik_scrambler, the program that
  this program is based on.

* The authors of THREE.js as well as the authors of it's various plugins that
  can be found in the js/third-party directory.

* The nice folks at https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/44sf8r/qwertycube_an_open_source_web_based_rubiks_cube/
  who gave me helpful feedback.

* The nice folks at https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/qwertycube-a-keyboard-operated-and-javascript-based-open-source-rubiks-cube.53934/
  who gave me helpful feedback.

* And last but not least my partner Erikalin Ashton who helped me test
  QWERTYcube and who also named it.

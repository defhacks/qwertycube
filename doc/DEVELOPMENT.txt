If you're interested in how QWERTYcube works or in contributing to it this
document may be helpful.

QWERTYcube is a JavaScript program that should be viewable by most modern
browsers that support WebGL.  It makes use of three.js as well as a few other
third party libraries that can be found in js/third-party.  The code for 
QWERTYcube itself is in js/qwertycube.

So far QWERTYcube has avoided JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery, but that's
something that can be considered if it significantly improves the interface.

To submit a change to QWERTYcube fork it and send a pull request.  It's github
page is https://github.com/selliott512/qwertycube .  If it's a lot of work and
you'd like to discuss it first you can reach me at selliott512@gmail.com

The organization and style of QWERTYcube should be clear, but here are a few
highlights:
1) Code is indented 4 spaces (no tabs).
2) Curly brackets are on the same line (K+R style).
3) Each JavaScript file is divided into four sections:
    // Public globals
    // Private globals
    // Public functions
    // Private functions
4) A symbol is public if it's referenced outside of the file it's in, and
   private otherwise.
5) The symbols are in alphabetical order in each of the four sections.
6) Public symbols are prefixed with the lower case basename of the file they
   are declared in.  For example cubiesCubeSize can be found in Cubies.js.
7) Private symbols are additionally prefixed with an underscore ("_").
8) Line endings are UNIX style (no Control-Ms).
9) All non-third party files are UTF-8.
